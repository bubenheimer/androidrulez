# Android Rulez
#### An efficient rule engine for Android

Ready for production use.

I have found the rule engine a great pattern for Android app initialization handling,
which commonly has to deal with somewhat complex asynchronous process flow and event handling
for API initialization. It is a generic rule engine, so it can be used for many other purposes.

for more information including a presentation from DevFest MN 2016.
