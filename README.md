# Android Rulez
#### Utility classes for an efficient Android rule engine

I have found the rule engine a great pattern for Android app initialization handling,
which commonly has to deal with somewhat complex asynchronous process flow and event handling
for API initialization. It is a generic rule engine, so it can be used for many other purposes.

This project just adds a few convenient Android-specific classes to the generic Kotlin rule engine.
That project's source is found at https://github.com/bubenheimer/kotlinrulez.

for more information including a presentation from DevFest MN 2016.
